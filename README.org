#+TITLE: Emacs Package Template

[[https://github.com/twlz0ne/emacs-package-template/actions?query=workflow%3ACI][file:https://github.com/twlz0ne/emacs-package-template/workflows/CI/badge.svg]]

This is a [[https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter][Cookiecutter]] template for [[https://emacs.org][Emacs]] packages.

It is very opinionated, and as such does not provide any toggles for
functionality.

* Features/Opinions

- Simple README scaffold with status badges
- Hosted on GitHub
- GPLv3, not a big fan myself but this is GNU Emacs after all
- Tests with ERT on Github Actions on several recent Emacs versions
- Setup for MELPA
- Dependencies installed with Cask

* Use

Install [[https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter][Cookiecutter]] in some way, for example

#+begin_src sh
pip3 install cookiecutter
#+end_src

You can run directly from GitHub:

#+begin_src sh
cookiecutter gh:twlz0ne/emacs-package-template
#+end_src

You will be prompted for some values to fill into the template.

Refer to [[https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][the Cookiecutter docs]] for more information.
